# food_vision

Developed a calorie-tracker mobile application that uses a deep learning model to recognise food from pictures and fetch nutritional
values associated with it. Other features include authentication, history of logged meals and consumed macronutrients statistics for
the day. This served as my practical support for my bachelor thesis.

This repo contains the frontend part of the application. You can access the backend [here](https://github.com/radu2147/food-api).
